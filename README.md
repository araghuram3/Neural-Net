# Neural-Net
This is the code for my basic Neural Network. It is just something simple that I felt like doing one day. 
It is useful to test out different neural network structures on a training data set and visualize the error to determine which
structure works best for your dataset.
In order to use this, you'll need Python 2.7, the numpy module and the matplotlib.pyplot module if you want to use the plotter class.

You can customize the number of inputs, the hidden layer structure, the activation/derivative activation function, the learning rate
and the starting bias. The plotter makes it easy to test different networks out and compare the errors as iterations pass on. 

More comments and resources on how to use it are within Network.py. 

Things to improve upon:
TODO implement a cost function instead of plotting error.
TODO have it so multiple outputs can be used.
TODO incorporate "momentum" later.
TODO update the bias variable on iterations.
TODO include more activation functions for trial purposes.
